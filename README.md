Risk-Taking in Perceptual-Motor Control

This project contains information pertaining to undergraduate research I conducted under the guidance of Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Dr. David Rosenbaum, in the Laboratory for Cognition and Action at Pennsylvania State University.

The experiment sought to devise a metric that would indicate individuals' level of risk-taking pertaining to their physical movements. To that end, participants--we studied the motions of 25 undergraduate students--were presented with a series of clicking tasks whereby they were asked to click one of the two target regions on the screen (see image below) within a known period of time.

If participants were able to successfully click their choice target in the allotted time, their score increased; otherwise, the score stayed constant. Hence, in order to maximize their score, participants should have attempted to click targets that were within their ability to click in the allotted time. Though this information would not have been evident immediately, after undergoing a large number of trials, they should have developed an understanding of a target's difficulty level based on their previous performance and their intuitive understanding of [Fitts' Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law). In short, when a participant attempted to click a target that was beyond their abilities, they had taken a risk, rather than selecting the control target. A participant's overall risk level was an aggregate of the risks they took throughout the trials.

This research culminated in a document submitted for publication in *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*.
